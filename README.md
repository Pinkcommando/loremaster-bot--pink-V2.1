# How to run
- Must be outside loremaster dungeon
- Have correct deck selected for bot to work properly
- Have config correctly set for your deck
- Have a quest pointing to wizard city or other page 1 worlds selected
- Have friend requests disabled

## Current bugs:
1) "Team Up" not pressed in the beginning. If this happens, CTRL + C in the
program and run it again. This usually only happens once in the beginning. 

2) Not having a quest pointing to wizard city or any other page one world will
cause the bot to break when trying to refill potions.

3) Not having friend requests disabled will break combat.
