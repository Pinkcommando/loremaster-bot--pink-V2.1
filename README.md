Credits to Starrfox, SirOlaf, notfaj, and Major. This wouldn't exist without you.

This is an updated take on the original loremaster bot released by Major.

Before you ask, YES, it uses configs (obviously, who wouldn't?). Make sure to
set them up properly with your deck. Suggested that you use a small deck, this
way you don't learn any new spells and get your hand cluttered.

Must be outside loremaster dungeon with correct deck selected for bot to work properly.

Current bugs:

1) "Team Up" not pressed in the beginning. If this happens, CTRL + C in the
program and run it again. This usually only happens once in the beginning. 

2) Not having a quest pointing to wizard city or any other page one world will
cause the bot to break when trying to refill potions.

3) Not having friend requests disabled will break combat.

Enjoy.
